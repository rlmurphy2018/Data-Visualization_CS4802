This source shows the spread of a measles outbreak among children. Populations with various percentages of vaccinated children are shown.

The simulation was created to demonstrate the importance of vaccinating children for Measles. Measles is highly contagious, its airborn and about 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with measles will get sick. Because of the likelyhood of spreading measles, especially after an outbreak in 2015, vaccination is increadibly important to keep populations healthy from a preventable sickness.

The visualization shows various levels of vaccinated populations, to show just how significant the spread can be. I thought it was incredibly important that the visulaization showed percentages for some real cities in the US. This makes the visualization much more real and important when it shows the viewer what could happen in places across the US.

You can also repeat the simualtion many times. This allows users to confirm that only the highest percentage of vaccinated populations will remain protected throughout measles outbreaks.
About 99% of measles vaccinations cause an immune response in the recipient to make them non-susceptible to measles. But the 1% who are vaccinated and still susceptible are represented in the popoulation, showing that it requires a large portion of the population to be vaccinated to protect these small percentages of people who are still susceptible.

Personally, I really like studying disease spread, so I thought this visualization was super cool.
A useful extension of this could be to make a map, or let users choose a city of interest that they would like to add to the mix and compare.
