# Week 4 Reflection

For this weeks reflection, I chose a visualization that compares the number of superbowl MVP's per position.

For every superbowl, the winning team, position, and MVP player are given. Each winning team is represented by a specific color. This color coding is not completely effective in allowing the viewer to pick out specific teams. Some of the colors are so similar that the user cannot distinguish one team from another. For example, the Patriots, Giants, and Cowboys are all a dark blue that are almost identical and even when side by side, they are difficult to tell apart. However, trying to keep the color coding similar to the teams actual color does help a viewer instinctively look for specific areas that represent their team.

The only way to tell apart the Patriots and Cowboys is to highlight over a specific MVP win to get more information. The interactive, highlight feature does help to provide more information but still doesn't help a viewer focus on a specific team of interest.

There is a built in filter feature that does allow viewers to choose one or more teams to stand out for comparison.

It would be nice if this feature could be extend to let viewers focus on players as well. Also, a filter allowing the offensive and defensive positions to be separated would be interesting and applicable since the title of the visualization is about showing data based on position.

Additionally, it would be interesting to filter by year, or at least provide data for the year as well.
