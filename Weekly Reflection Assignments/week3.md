A Day in the Life of Americans

This visualization follows the 24-hour daily routines of Americans. The data is based off of a survey of 1,000 people in 2014. The data is visualized in multiple formats. It has an animated format that allows viewers to watch a day in motion. Key points of the day are later shown in still shots to highlight what people are doing. The static images are in chronological order so that they can be followed similar to the animation, and highlight the main points from the animation.

A strong point of the animation was to point out the major peaks of activity at certain times. This helps eliminate some instances of the user missing the overall point. It attempts to overcome change blindness by drawing attention to the important points.

The static images could have been enhanced by giving percentages for each activity, like what was shown in the animated version.

Additionally, it would have been nice if the visualization took into account various the days of the week, or at least split up the data into weekdays and weekends.
