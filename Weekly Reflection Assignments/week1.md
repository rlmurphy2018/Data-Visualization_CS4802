The article demonstrates to readers how easy it can be to maninipulate data for a desired result. Immediately, an interactive graphic is provided to users, demonstrating that in a matter of seconds you can prove whatever politcal hypothesis you chose. By chosing to what variables you take into account, it is fairly simple to give the results you want.

After catching the attention of readers, the article goes on to talk about how there are 1,800 possible variations of results from that one interactive. Making it incredibly clear that even just choosing which statistics to include can have a great affect on a conclusion.

I personally enjoyed how the article then talked about actual studies that were performed on P-hacking. This gave the reader not only the experience of P-hacking, but more data and studies that backed up the fact that numbers can be maniuplated. It makes me wary and even question the statistics produced, because people usually put their trust in numbers. But this article proves that numbers may not always reveal the truth.

While it is worrisome that we cannot always trust the data we see, it shows just how important it is to look at data from multiple angles. Not only that, but it is important to have multiple people, and years of results piling up to come to a conclusive and backed up result.
