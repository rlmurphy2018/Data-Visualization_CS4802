This visualization uses heat maps to demonstrate the occurrences of various diseases. Each visualization shows data for a specific state at a specific time. There are 7 infectious diseases, each shown in a separate heat map, showing a selected time period of about 70 years.
On each map, there is a clearly marked line as to when the vaccine for the disease was introduced. This helps emphasize the point of the data visualization, to show that vaccines have positively impacted the occurrence of infectious disease throughout the US.

The various colors shown on the heat map are used to represent the number of people infected by the disease at that time period. When the user highlights over the color block, the state and year are given as well as a number. I'm assuming this number is specific to the level/intensity of infection.

It would have been nice if the highlighted block turns a different color. Currently, when highlighted, the selected block turns a light blue, this color is a little close to some of the other light blue colors, which can make it hard to distinguish which block is actually highlighted. Instead, the highlighted block could turn black to make it stand out more.

Additionally, it can be a little deceptive that each heat map shows a different time line. But the fact that each block of time remains the same size and represents the same amount of time helps.
