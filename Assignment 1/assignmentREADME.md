Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===


This is a starting project to make sure you can write and host a webpage that generates graphics using d3. 

The primary goal is to be able to generate graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons) at different locations on the screen with different colors. 

The secondary goal is to introduce you to coding on GitHub, including creating a gh-pages branch to host your visualizations.

You may write everything from scratch, or start with demo programs from books or the web. 
If you do start with code that you found, you **must identify** the source of the code in your README and, most importantly, make non-trivial changes to the code to make it your own so you really learn what you're doing. 

For example, you could download one of the d3.js examples, read it through so you understand what it's doing, and then change the appearance of the graphical output to use different color schemes, different primitive shapes, different layouts of the primitives, and so on.

If you need a Git/GitHub refreseher, see [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/), the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) (especially the ones on Hello World, and Understanding the GitHub Flow, and Forking Projects), and [CodeSchool's Try Git Course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).

Requirements
---

1. Your project should contain at least four kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons) in different colors. 
2. Your document should identify the source of the code if you start with code that you found. 
3. Your code should be forked from the GitHub repo and linked using GitHub pages. See the "GitHub Details" section below for detailed instructions on how to do this.

GitHub Details
---

- Make sure I have your GitHub Username (collected through the course survey) and have added you to the "Class" team. You'll get an email from GitHub when this is done and you will be able to access the assignment repository.
- Fork the GitHub Repository for Assignment 1. You now have a copy associated with your username.
- Make changes to index.html to fulfill the project requirements. 
- Make sure your "master" branch matches your "gh-pages" branch. See the GitHub Guides referenced above if you need help.
- Edit the README.md with a link to your gh-pages site "http://YourUsernameGoesHere.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html".
- To submit, make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on the original repository.

Vis Details
---

For this project you should use d3.js. 
You can download examples from [d3.js](http://d3js.org) or start from scratch.

See the [Using d3js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#using) documentation for how to run your own local server.

Creative solutions are welcome! In the past I've seen smiling lollipops, portraits, and more.

Go beyond the minimum requirements of this project.
Experiment with other aspects of the [d3 API](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference) and [d3 Tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials). 
Try making the elements interactive, for example, or animate them.

Grading
---

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
100 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

I will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Total -- 120

(0 will be assigned if the code won't run.)

Functionality -- 80

20 -- Circles and Rectangles  
20 -- Lines  
20 -- Polygons  
20 -- Different colors  

README Quality -- 20

5 -- A description of what you have created. Screenshots are helpful.  
10 -- A working link to hosted files  
5 -- Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement -- 10  
Design Achievement -- 10

Remember, it is up to *you* to define what constitutes a technical and design achievements.
Be ambitious as these are designed to allow you to shape your learning.
These are the only way to move from B to A territory.

Rachel Murphy Assignment 1
Due 17 January

Link to gh- page: http://rlmurphy2018.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html

Description:
I used rectangles, circles, and polygons to draw a turtle. I added a design to the turtle shell using both lines and polygons.
I have only ever used Java and Racket in CS courses so I also took some time to experiment with google fonts.
The turtles shell can be changed to dark blue if you hold the mouse over it.

Design Acheivments:
- Used the given shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, and polygons) to design a turtle
- Incorporated fonts 

Technical Acheivments:
- Added the ability to change the shell color of the turtle using the mouseover functions
- Figured how to create a design on the shell using lines and polygons

Addition of mouseover activity was based off of: http://jsfiddle.net/skysigal/dkewm4re/
